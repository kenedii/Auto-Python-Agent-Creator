    "- Create File: <cfil>foldername/file.py</cfil>\n"
    "- Edit File: <efil file=\"foldername/file.py\">Entire file text</efil>\n"
    "- Execute Code: <exec>foldername/file.py</exec>\n"
    "- Request More Information: <rinf>Prompt the user</rinf>\n"

    "c.save()\n"
    "</efil>\n"
    "<exec>reports/generate_pdf.py</exec>\n"
    "To include images in the PDF, generate them using libraries like Matplotlib, save them as files, and add them with c.drawImage(). For example:\n"
    "<efil file=\"reports/generate_report.py\">\n"
    "from reportlab.pdfgen import canvas\n"
    "import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n"
    "\n"

    "c.drawImage('plot.png', 100, 500, width=400, height=300)\n"
    "c.save()\n"
    "</efil>\n"
    "For APA-style formatting, structure the PDF with a title page, appropriate fonts (e.g., Times New Roman, 12pt), 1-inch margins, double spacing where applicable, and sections like abstract and references if specified by the user. Use ReportLab's Platypus framework for more complex layouts if needed.\n"
